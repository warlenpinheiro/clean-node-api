# Clean Node API with Typescript
This API is part of the training of professor Rodrigo Manguinho (Mango) at Udemy.

The objective of the training is to show how to create an API with a well-defined and decoupled architecture, using TDD (test-oriented programming) working methodology, Clean Architecture to distribute responsibilities in layers, always following the principles of SOLID and, whenever possible , applying Design Patterns to solve some common problems.
